# Python Template Repository

This repository serves as a **template** for Python projects. It includes a pre-configured setup for build management, unit testing, continuous integration, static analysis, code style adherence, and component specification. The repository is designed to be fully functional "out of the box" and follows best practices for software development.

---

## **Features**
- **Testing Framework**: [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- **Dependency Management**: [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and efficient dependency management.
- **Code Formatting**: [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) for linting and formatting.
- **Static Analysis**: [Mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) and Ruff for type checking and static analysis.
- **Code Coverage**: [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for measuring test coverage.
- **CI/CD**: [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Pre-configured Templates**: Issue and pull request templates for standardized contributions.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.11 or higher.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.
- A [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) account for CI/CD (optional).

---

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-template-repo.git
   cd python-template-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install the `src` package in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

---

### **Running Tests**
1. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

2. Generate a coverage report:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html tests/
   ```
   Open `htmlcov/index.html` to view the coverage report.

3. Run static analysis:
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   mypy src/
   ```

---

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**
This repository is configured with CircleCI for continuous integration. The CI pipeline:
- Runs tests.
- Generates a test coverage report.
- Stores test results and artifacts.

To set up CircleCI:
1. Go to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and log in with your GitHub account.
2. Follow the prompts to set up the repository.
3. Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the pipeline.
